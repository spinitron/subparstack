## Documents

- [What's up with Substack's comments app?](https://github.com/subparstack/subparstack/blob/main/Comments%20JS%20App%20Analysis.md)

    Boy, does it suck! But why? We take a deep dive into the cascade of failures in this project's design. 
    (Actually, it's very shallow but it's enough for now.)
    
- [Hacks that make Substack work better](https://github.com/subparstack/subparstack/blob/main/Console%20Snippets.md).
